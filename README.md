# Personal Blogging Platform API

- Difficulty: Easy
- Skills and technologies used: CRUD for main operations, databases (SQL or NoSQL), server-side RESTful API.

This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog. This implies that you’d have to create a backend API with the following responsibilities:

1. Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.
2. Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.
3. Create a new article to be published.
4. Delete a single article, specified by the ID.
5. Update a single article, again, you’d specify the article using its ID.
